# tictac01
tictacto01: my first program ever made, i know i know, it's no hello world, but here we are.  I think I made this september of 2018, but this is just a rough guess.

Basically, it's a completely random tic-tac-to game, the computer has no strategy to its responses whatsoever.  Additionally, it asks some sassy questions towards the end, as the longer I spent working on this the more tired I got.
